        <p>So, where's your money? Personally, I reckon India have had the upper hand all Test, and they have put themselves 
            back on course this evening. But Joe Root did his damnedest to drag the game back for his side before Jasprit Bumrah's five-for - 
            and nine for the match - prevented a testing target from becoming an insurmountable one. That said, Anderson has been more of a threat this summer 
            with an older ball than a newer one. A huge final day coming up... weather permitting. From Miller, KK, Thilak and the team, thanks and goodnight!
